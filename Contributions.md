# Contributor Guidelines

We welcome contributions from other developers to help us make the ChatHub even better. Before you contribute there are a number of things that you should know. 

Firstly, please familiarise yourself with the [Github Contribution flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

1. Create a new issue for the feature
2. Fork the project
3. Create a branch
4. Add commits
5. Open a pull request
6. Code review
7. Merge with develop branch

Every feature should follow this procedure.
